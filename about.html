			<p id='abput-p-1'>I am a native Detroiter, and have been doing portrait work since the late 1970's. I work
			in different media: charcoal, pencil, conte crayon, oils and egg tempera. From 1976 -
			1979 I was a student in the fine arts department of the College for Creative Studies. I
			also obtained a degree in Early Childhood Development from Wayne State University,
			and in 2006 completed the requirements for a Fine Arts major at Madonna University in
			Livonia, Michigan.</p>			

			<p>My studies led me to a deep appreciation of Edward Curtis' Native American
			photographs of the late 1800's. I subsequently focused my portrait work on the Native
			American People, participating in numerous juried exhibitions in the Midwest during the
			late 1970's and 1980's. Because of the deep respect I developed through my work with
			the Native American People, I was the only non-Native American artist invited to
			participate at a Pow-Wow at Fort Wayne in Detroit.</p>			

			<p>In recent years, my skills and interests broadened. After being commissioned to paint
			the icon, Christ Pantocrator, I shifted my focus to include the study of icons and
			iconology. With a love for ancient religious art, I continued to pursue the ancient crafts
			of egg-tempera and gilding in my quest to preserve and follow the historical traditions.</p>			

			<p>Water color-is my current passion! Upon inheriting a complete supply of paints, brushes
			and paper, I began to explore portraiture through the art of water color. The use of color
			coupled with a much quicker work completion time, soon made it my newfound love and
			medium of choice!</p>
